problem Statement: Given an array/list of length ‘N’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. Some ‘K’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint. You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘N’ boards under the constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 4, boards[] = {5, 5, 5, 5}, k = 2
Result: 10
Explanation: We can divide the boards into 2 equal-sized partitions, so each painter gets 10 units of the board and the total time taken is 10.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 4, boards[] = {10, 20, 30, 40}, k = 2
Result: 60
Explanation: We can divide the first 3 boards for one painter and the last board for the second painter.

We can allocate the boards to the painters in several ways but it is clearly said in the question that we have to allocate the boards in such a way that the painters can paint all the boards in the minimum possible time. The painters will work simultaneously.

// same code as book allocation q9

 Problem Essence:
You're given:

boards[] of size N, each with a length (like pages in book allocation)

K painters

Each painter paints contiguous boards

Painters work in parallel, so the total time is determined by the slowest (i.e., largest assigned sum)

🎯 Objective:
Minimize the maximum time taken by a painter, under the constraint that:

Each painter paints continuous boards

Boards cannot be split

All boards must be painted

🧠 First Principles Breakdown:
What must be true?
The time taken by the slowest painter determines the total time

If we assign too much to one painter, total time increases

We want to balance the board loads

What can be derived?
Minimum time = max(boards) (since someone must paint the longest board)

Maximum time = sum(boards) (if one painter does all)

We can binary search the minimum time possible

This is Binary Search on Answer + Greedy check:

Can we divide the boards into ≤ k painters so that no painter paints more than X length?

✅ Final Code (C++)
cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool isPossible(vector<int>& boards, int k, int mid) {
    int painterCount = 1;
    int currSum = 0;

    for (int length : boards) {
        if (length > mid) return false;

        if (currSum + length <= mid) {
            currSum += length;
        } else {
            painterCount++;
            currSum = length;
        }
    }
    return painterCount <= k;
}

int minTimeToPaint(vector<int>& boards, int k) {
    int low = *max_element(boards.begin(), boards.end());
    int high = 0;
    for (int x : boards) high += x;

    int ans = high;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

        if (isPossible(boards, k, mid)) {
            ans = mid;
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> boards1 = {5, 5, 5, 5};
    vector<int> boards2 = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    int k = 2;

    cout << "Example 1: " << minTimeToPaint(boards1, k) << endl;  // Output: 10
    cout << "Example 2: " << minTimeToPaint(boards2, k) << endl;  // Output: 60

    return 0;
}
🔁 Dry Run for [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2
mid = 60 → split into [10, 20, 30] and [40]

Two painters used → valid → try smaller

mid = 50 → too many painters needed → invalid

Final answer = 60

✅ Key Insight:
This code is exactly the same as Book Allocation because:

Book pages = board lengths

Students = painters

Goal: minimize the max load (pages/time)

🔄 Variants That Use Same Template:
Book Allocation

Split Array Largest Sum (LC 410)

Painter Partition Problem

Allocate Minimum Number of Pages

Load Balancing Problems

Let me know if you'd like:

A dry run of this logic on your own input

A DP-based version (if painters had cooldown, rest, or per-board cost)

Or a problem that’s 1 level harder for practice
